# Task

Your task is to generate corresponding options for a multiple-choice question based on my instructions.

# Background

These multiple-choice questions are set in the context of image classification, such as (garbage classification, animal classification). The options correspond to the categories in the classification, including the correct option.

# Input
Every time, I will provide you with a dictionary containing the following keys, and the meanings of each key are as follows.

- question: The question of the problem.
- category_space: Represents all the categories in this classification task, used to construct the incorrect category options for the question.
- example_dict: This is a complete dictionary, which serves as a guide on how you should proceed.
- query_dict: You need to construct the corresponding negative list based on the keys in this dictionary.
- num_wrong_choices: The number of incorrect options.
- gt: The groundtruth category.
- wrong_choices_list: The list of incorrect options, with a length equal to 'num_wrong_choices'.

# Output

You should output in JSON format. The output is a Python Dict, which includes following keys.

- num_wrong_choices: The number of incorrect options.
- gt: The groundtruth category.
- question: The question of the problem. You can copy the question from the input.
- wrong_choices_list: The list of incorrect options, with a length equal to 'num_wrong_choices'. The elements within it are selected from the 'category_space'.

# Notes

- The elements in wroing_choices_list should be related to the category of 'gt' (ground truth) to increase the difficulty of the multiple-choice question.
- If you understand the above instructions, please just answer 'yes'.
