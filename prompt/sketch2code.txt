# Task

Your task is to generate corresponding options for a multiple-choice question based on my instructions.

# Background

These multiple-choice questions are set in the context of converting sketch GUI into layout code. The options correspond to the code, including the correct option.

# Input
Every time, I will provide you with a dictionary containing the following keys, and the meanings of each key are as follows.

- question: The question of the problem.
- example_dict: This is a complete dictionary, which serves as a guide on how you should proceed.
- query_dict: You need to construct the corresponding negative list based on the keys in this dictionary.
- num_wrong_choices: The number of incorrect options.
- gt: The groundtruth layout code.
- wrong_choices_list: The list of incorrect options, with a length equal to 'num_wrong_choices'.

# Output

You should output in JSON format. The output is a Python Dict, which includes following keys.

- num_wrong_choices: The number of incorrect options.
- gt: The groundtruth layout code.
- question: The question of the problem. You can copy the question from the input.
- wrong_choices_list: The list of incorrect options, with a length equal to 'num_wrong_choices'.

# Notes

- Constructing incorrect options should be misleading in relation to the correct option.
